# Framingham-Heart-Disease-Prediction-SVC
Welcome to my first machine learning project: Framingham Heart Disease Prediction ! This project uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. It’s a simple way to explore how machine learning can be applied to healthcare data.

This project was created as part of my learning journey, and I’m sharing it here to document my progress. I’m still new to machine learning, so feel free to provide feedback or suggestions!
